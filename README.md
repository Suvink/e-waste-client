### What am I building

Recently my friend <a href="https://dev.to/jinaleey">@jinaleey</a> came up with the idea of having an e-waste collection service where customers can request a pickup and handover their e-waste in exchange for points. These points can be redeemed into Mobile Phone Credits, Supermarket loyalty points and many more. So she and I thought of building the system since e-waste management is an issue for many communities around the world.

### Description

<b>Customers</b>
Customers can create an account in the system and then place a request for a pickup. They can specify their location, item description, weight, etc and place a request. Once a collector picks up the request, the customer can see the contact details of the collector as well. Then once picked up, customer's account is credited with points and the job ends.<br>

### Background
The hardware and software changed the morphology, facilities, etc. with time and thereby making most of the older IT equipment or hardware as obsolete. This activity collection generated a huge pool of junk hardware which is termed as e-waste. Point is that most people don't have the technical know-how to dump any hardware that is already in the works. The main problem in the country is that we donâ€™t have a place to store obsolete hardware. Therefore, people try to burn such waste, and that process produces harmful gases to the environment. An example, Cathode ray tube based equipments (TVs, computer monitors, ATM, video cameras and more) are disposed as junk. Then Lead, Barium and other heavy metals leak into the groundwater and release toxic phosphor. And, when burning computer wires and printed circuit boards, PAH (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) gets released in to water, air and soil. Therefor an environment-friendly recycling methodology for the disposal of e-waste has become a necessity now. 

Another problem is that there are small groups who are organized to collect this type of waste, and such groups do not provide a reasonable amount of money to the customers. That process has no customer satisfaction and customers don't have much of a choice but giving those groups their e-waste and get rid of them.

So that lead us to our solution, e-waste.

### How I built it 
The project uses VueJS for the frontend and Firebase as the backend. The users are authenticated using Firebase Authentication. The data are stored in a Firebase Realtime Database providing realtime updates for the users. Moreover, in the future stages, the points calculation method will also be hosted as a Firebase Cloud Function.
